= Introduction =
The Salesforce.com platform moves very quickly. New platform features have come out that should be taken advantage of. 

= Current State = 
New platform features that could be refactored into our code where appropriate:
 * Batch Apex
 * Scheduled Apex
 * Custom settings
 * SOQL improvements (group by, having, etc.)

Best practices for coding on the Salesforce.com platform are not all followed in the code base.

= Problems with current State =

 * efficiency and quality can always be improved
 * we use picklists to store config variables
 * there are many places where unhandled exceptions can occur
 * you can't disable functionality without uninstalling the packages
 * test coverage is incomplete
