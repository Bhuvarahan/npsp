#summary Developer Sprint Report Out

= Introduction =

June 9-11, 11 people gathered in San Francisco for the first inaugural developer sprint. There were 6 community members, 3 Foundation staff, and 2 Salesforce.com employees.

We started out the first morning with a quick round-the-table intro session. After that I (Steve Andersen) did a quick intro to the nonprofit starter pack to get everyone on the same page. Some of the folks at the table knew the starter pack very well, others were new to it.

Next, I ran down the list of potential projects, explaining them in detail and answering questions as they came up. Everyone then selected which projects they wanted to be a part of. We generally broke into teams of two, with a couple folks taking on projects on their own.

From there the teams began design conversations--how best to proceed in addressing the projects they had chosen. Conversations were fluid and brought other team members in frequently. There was a real feel that everyone was open to help out everyone else, and experience and input was shared constantly through the day. We had technical experts and domain experts in the room. When someone had a question, they would ask it of someone specific across the room. Others would listen and chime in if they had input. There was usually a short discussion and then work resumed.

I floated most of the day, giving NPSP-specific advice as necessary, helping with environments, and logistics of meals, facilities and technology.

At the end of the first day we did a quick run down of where we stood on our projects, which was a good exercise.

After lunch on the last day we did a demo of each project. It was great to see all the projects in completed form, or in progress as the case was.

 * Contact Merge interface
  * We improved the contact merge included with the NPSP by adding paint your perfect record functionality

  * merge leads to existing contacts
  * Status: code is committed to the package and will be included in next release

= What worked? =

 * amazing group of people
 * good collaboration
 * communal dinners were great for getting to know folks
 * periodic checkins about where people are on their projects
 * demo of all code at the end of the sprint
 * having very knowledgeable staff from Salesforce.com there was really great. Andrew Waite was able to definitively answer any Apex of VF question, complete with historical info about when and why. Ron Hess gave great implementation advice.
 * It was great to have a mix of coding skill level--great learning opportunities

= What didn't work? =
 
 * would have been better to have customer need tied to the projects - e.g. 10 customers need to create Opps on lead conversion
 * conference rooms get old by the end of the day
 * it would be great to have more people next time

= Next time? =

I want to replicate this event as I think it was very successful. Because everyone was a volunteer and covered their own travel and lodging, it was a very low-cost event. Now that we've done one successful event I would consider doing a larger event, having remote attendees, and other ideas.
